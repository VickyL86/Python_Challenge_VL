# Python_Challenge_VL

Dear Supreme Central Grader, 

You will be glad to know, that this week I was able to create not one, but two new pivot tables! This time you will see them in Python - which is pretty awesome because a before back I didn't even
know what Python was. It took me only 8 hours to accomplish this, which is not bad all things considered :)  

This week I used heaps of resources which I referenced directly in the code for your review. I enjoyed this assignment way more than the VBA since I was able to use the 
ViSCo this time - took care of misspellings and othe issues. I hope you will enjoy this sad txt pivot table, because I actually did have fun making it - even if it took me a whole Saturday :D 

I hope you are doing well that the paths won't give you trouble.

Notable Mentions:
This week Dwight and Mr. Murderbritches did not assist with the homework, but they remain supportive so I would like to allocate to them a special mental support credit. My boyfriend this week did not 
provide snacks, but I think the Visual Basic week took a bigger toll on him and he is still recovering. Among resources used this week: Stack Overflow, Learn Python Programin Website, class modules, and many more. 

Thank you for your unwavering support in my quest to become a Python Jedi Master. 

Best, 

Vicky
